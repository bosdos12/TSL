# TSL Tutor App

Hi there. We are Software Gates and we are here for a reason!<br>
Have you ever heard about Turkish Sign Language?<br>
<b>Well, better late than never!</b><br>

<p>
Turkish Sign Language is a pretty simple non-verbal language that doesn't really require knowledge of Turkish to learn it. But the problem with it is that it has very few published information especially in English<sup>[1]</sup>.
</p>

<p>
As far as we are concerned, this language is widely used in two countries - Cyprus and Turkey. When we say "widely used" we mean used among deaf people and their relatives because according to our rough survey <b>majority of people</b>, at least in Cyprus(North), <b>don't even know what TSL(TID) stands for</b>
</p>

<p>
Ignorance is a major issue and someone should popularise Sign Language in these countries because deaf people lack basic social needs.
They can't find friends, can't find love, can't even talk to a random person. <b>If we don't go into action these people may be doomed to loneliness!</b> It is not just a bunch of people there are actually 2.5 million deaf people in Turkey alone <sup>[2]</sup> that's more than entire population of some countries.

<h3>What can we do?</h3>

<p>
Well, as cool programmists we need to create a simple and friendly app that people may have on their mobile phones and use on their way to school, home, pub or somewhere else. 
</p>

<p>
We will start simple and then will make app more and more advanced. My main vision is this: simple tutor app --> tutor app + sign chat (you send message in text it comes in signs) + no ads or monetisation (completely free/at least for first year :) )
</p>

<h3>How to start</h3>

<p>
Clone this repository to your computer and then go to www folder and press index.html and contemplate the app. For additional information on how app works and how it is converted from web app to the mobile go to info/Project Structue
</p>

<h3>Final words!</h3>
<p>
We are the ones who can make the difference.
