# TSL Tutor App

Hi there. We are Software Gates and we are here for a reason!<br>
Have you ever heard about Turkish Sign Language?<br>
<b>Well, better late than never!</b><br>

<p>
Turkish Sign Language is a pretty simple non-verbal language that doesn't really require knowledge of Turkish to learn it. But the problem with it is that it has very few published information especially in English<sup>[1]</sup>.
</p>

<p>
As far as we are concerned, this language is widely used in two countries - Cyprus and Turkey. When we say "widely used" we mean used among deaf people and their relatives because according to our rough survey <b>majority of people</b>, at least in Cyprus(North), <b>don't even know what TSL(TID) stands for</b>
</p>

<p>
Ignorance is a major issue and someone should popularise Sign Language in these countries because deaf people lack basic social needs.
They can't find friends, can't find love, can't even talk to a random person. <b>If we don't go into action these people may be doomed to loneliness!</b>
</p>


<h3>What can we do?</h3>

<p>
Well, as cool programmists we need to create a simple and friendly app that people may have on their mobile phones and use on their way to school, home, pub or somewhere else. 
</p>

<p>
We will start simple and then will make app more and more advanced. My main vision is this: <sub>simple tutor app</sub> -> tutor app + sign chat (you send message in text it comes in signs) + no ads or moetisation (completely free/at least for first year :) )
