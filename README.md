Hi there. We are Software Gates and we are here for a reason!<br>
Have you ever heard about Turkish Sign Language?<br>
<b>Well, better late than never!<b><br>
<br>
Turkish Sign Language is a pretty simple non-verbal language that doesn't really require knowledge of Turkish to learn it. But the problem with it is that it has very few published information especially in English<sup>[1]</sup>.<br>
<br>
As far as we are concerned, this language is widely used in two countries - Cyprus and Turkey. When we say "widely used" we mean used among deaf people and their relatives because according to our rough survey majority of people, at least in Cyprus(North), don't even know what TSL(TID) stand for so it is a major issue someone should popularise Sign Language here because deaf people lack normal communication thay can't find friends, can't find love, can't even talk to a random person if we don't make a change these people will be doomed to loneliness!
